	My name is Blake Lun and I'm a freshman this year at Texas A&M. I'm a computer science major and planning on minoring in 
	business. I was born in Florida, but I moved to Sugar Land, Texas before I was even one year old. I have one younger sister 
	who's starting high school this year. Both of my parents are chinese, and they both attended the University of Florida. My dad 
	is a pipeline engineer while my mom teaches piano.
